# Create a user with no permissions 

We need to create a new user with no permissions and generate out access keys

```sh
aws iam create-user --user-name sts-machine-user
aws iam create-access-key --user-name sts-machine-user --output table
```



Copy the access key and secret here 

```sh
aws configure 
```



Then edit credentials file to change away from default profile

```sh
open ~/.aws/credentials
```



Test who you are:

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile sts
```



Make sure you don't have access to S3

```sh
aws s3 ls --profile sts
```


# Create a Role

# Use new user credentials and assume role
